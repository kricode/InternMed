# InternMed: A Collaborative Effort

InternMed represents the culmination of extensive collaboration between a project manager (me) and a medical professional (a medical intern), with the project manager taking the lead in development and the doctor providing essential guidance on the requirements and functionalities needed in the application.

Throughout development, myproject management and technical skills were instrumental in translating the doctor's requirements into a functional and user-friendly application. I have conducted feasibility studies, led brainstorming sessions, and iteratively refined the application based on feedback from the medical professional, ensuring that the final product met the needs of its intended users.

## Project Manager's Role:

- **Guided Development:** The project manager (you) led the development efforts, leveraging technical expertise to implement the doctor's requirements into the application.
- **Feasibility Studies:** Extensive feasibility studies were conducted by the project manager to assess the viability and potential challenges of implementing various features, ensuring that the application met the doctor's needs.
- **Brainstorming Sessions:** The project manager facilitated brainstorming sessions to generate innovative ideas and solutions, ensuring that the application's functionalities aligned with the doctor's requirements.
- **Iterative Refinement:** InternMed underwent iterative refinement cycles, led by the project manager, who meticulously analyzed feedback from the medical professional to enhance the application's functionality and usability.
- **Prompt Implementation of Changes:** Changes and improvements suggested during the development process were promptly implemented by the project manager, ensuring that InternMed continuously evolved to meet the evolving needs of its users.
- **Implemented MVC Pattern:** InternMed follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating the application into three interconnected components - the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (logic). This design ensures clear separation of concerns and facilitates maintainability and scalability of the application codebase.
- **State and Route Management with GetX:** GetX is utilized for efficient state management and route management in InternMed, providing a lightweight yet powerful solution for managing application state and navigation. Its reactive nature simplifies development and enhances performance, contributing to a seamless user experience.

## Doctor's Contribution:

- **Guidance and Requirements:** The medical professional provided essential guidance on the requirements and functionalities needed in the application, ensuring that InternMed addressed the specific needs of medical interns and residents.
- **Feedback and Validation:** The doctor provided valuable feedback throughout the development process, validating the application's features and ensuring their alignment with medical practices and regulations.

## Features:

## Frontend Customizations:

- **Color Palette:** The color palette for InternMed's user interface was meticulously chosen by me to create a visually appealing and cohesive design. Colors were selected to enhance readability, usability, and overall aesthetics.
- **Icons:** Custom icons were designed and integrated into InternMed's user interface to provide intuitive visual cues and enhance the user experience. Each icon was carefully crafted to represent its corresponding action or feature, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

## Features:

- **User Authentication:** Seamlessly sign up and log in using Gmail authentication, ensuring secure access for verified medical professionals. Admin validation workflow ensures data integrity.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Enjoy a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, featuring a notification center and easy access to profile editing and logout functionalities, meticulously crafted through the vision and UI expertise of the project manager.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Department-specific grids ensure confidentiality, allowing doctors to focus on their assigned patients while adhering to privacy regulations, a result of collaborative brainstorming and design between the project manager and medical expert.
- **Customized Patient Details:** Tailor patient records with pertinent details based on medical specialties, such as thoracic surgery or gynecology, ensuring comprehensive and specialized care, conceived through the innovative ideas and feature conceptualization of the project manager.
- **Vital Signs Recording:** Record vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and blood sugar levels, all conveniently stored in a database with timestamps, envisioned and implemented by the project manager to enhance patient care monitoring.
- **Post-Surgical/Postpartum Features:** Adapted interface for post-surgical or postpartum scenarios, facilitating detailed entry of surgery details or birth-related information, a reflection of the project manager's dedication to meeting the diverse needs of medical professionals.
- **Real-time Updates and Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging delivers real-time updates and notifications to users, keeping them informed of new patient entries, record updates, and administrative actions, a feature envisioned by the project manager to ensure timely communication and data synchronization.
- **Offline Support:** Even in environments with limited internet connectivity, InternMed ensures users can access and modify patient records, leveraging Flutter's local storage and Firebase's offline persistence feature, a testament to the project manager's commitment to usability and accessibility.
- **Secure Data Storage:** Data encryption techniques ensure sensitive patient information is securely stored and transmitted, adhering to industry best practices for data protection and privacy, a priority established by the project manager to safeguard patient confidentiality.
